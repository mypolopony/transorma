I stopped really looking at my email about two years ago, partly because the gmail web interface is terrible and does not have a lot of sorting or batch-action capabilities. So this quick script sorts all of the mail so that I can deal with it sensibly. 

This script will run through your unread mail and sort it by sender. From there on, you can:
- create whitelists / blacklists
- enable logic to specify filters
- make emails actionable
